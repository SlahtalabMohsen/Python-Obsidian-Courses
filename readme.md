# ðŸŽ“ Python Obsidian Courses Dashboard

This project helps you organize, track, and visualize your progress through video-based courses using Markdown dashboards compatible with Obsidian.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Course Dashboards:** Generates a checklist for each course folder containing video files.
- **Progress Tracking:** Calculates session and time progress based on watched videos.
- **Smart Tags:** Adds tags based on video names (e.g., `#beginner`, `#project`).
- **Video Duration:** Extracts and displays video durations using `ffprobe`.
- **Main Index:** Creates a summary dashboard linking to all course dashboards.
- **Obsidian-Friendly:** All dashboards are Markdown files with clickable links to open videos.

## How It Works

1. **Scan Folders:** The script scans your main courses folder for subfolders containing video files.
2. **Generate Dashboards:** For each course, it creates a Markdown checklist in a `Dashboards` folder.
3. **Track Progress:** Mark videos as watched by checking the boxes in the Markdown file.
4. **View Summary:** The main `Index.md` shows progress for all courses.
