Progress Tracking: Calculates session and time progress based on watched videos.
Smart Tags: Adds tags based on video names (e.g., #beginner, #project).
Video Duration: Extracts and displays video durations using ffprobe.
Main Index: Creates a summary dashboard linking to all course dashboards.
Obsidian-Friendly: All dashboards are Markdown files with clickable links to open videos.
How It Works
